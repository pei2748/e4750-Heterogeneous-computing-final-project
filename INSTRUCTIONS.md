2. A students copy of the assignment gets created automatically with a special name - students have to rename the repo per instructions below
3. The solution(s) to the assignment have to be submitted inside that repository as a set of "solved" Jupyter Notebooks, and several modified python files which reside in directories/subdirectories
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory "figures" which prove that the assignment has been done in the cloud
